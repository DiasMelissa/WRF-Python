Educational and practical examples on using WRF-Python for WRF post-processing and meteorological analysis.
# üå¶Ô∏è WRF-Python: Analysis and Visualization with the WRF Model

This repository gathers examples and tutorials on how to use the **WRF-Python** library to manipulate, analyze, and visualize outputs from the **WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model)**.  
The goal is to provide supporting material for meteorologists, researchers, and students who wish to explore WRF-generated data in a practical and automated way using Python.

## üìö About WRF-Python

**WRF-Python** is a library developed by **NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research)** that allows simplified access to variables and coordinates from WRF output files.  
With it, you can compute derived meteorological variables (such as potential temperature, wind components, CAPE/CIN, etc.) and create customized visualizations using **Matplotlib**, **Cartopy**, and **xarray**.
